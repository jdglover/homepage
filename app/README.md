Flaskapp homepage
=========
Written in Python 2.76. using Flask 0.10. 

This page is a simple Flask app. The vast majority of the page is static, but 
there is a working contact form on the email page.  Simply open the routes.py
file and fill in your own server information.  You'll also need to modify the 
'sender' and 'recipients' in line 52 to reflect the addresses you want to use.

Thanks to Jenil Gogari and Thomas Park for the outstanding bootswatch!
